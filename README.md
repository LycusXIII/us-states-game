**U.S. States Game**

### **Project Description**

This Python project is a fun and educational way to learn the locations of all 50 U.S. states! Ô∏è

### **Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.12 installed
   * `turtle` library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

3. **Installation:**
   * Clone this repository or download the Python files (`main.py`, `states.py`, `50_states.csv`, `blank_states_img.gif`).

5. **Usage:**
   * Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   * Run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`

### **Gameplay**

* Inside the popup enter the name of 1 of the 50 states if correct it will be displayed on the map if incorrect the popup will be shown again.
* Type `exit` to close the game and get a csv file of the states you have missed.

### **Project Structure**

* **`main.py`:** Main game loop, handles user interaction, state tracking, and manages the `Display` object.
* **`states.py`:** Defines the **`Display object`** class which utilizes the `turtle` library to create the map and show state names upon correct guesses.


### **Dependencies**

* `pandas` (for CSV data manipulation)
* This project relies on the `turtle` library, which is part of the standard Python library.
